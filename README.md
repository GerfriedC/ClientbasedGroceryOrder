# ClientbasedGroceryOrder
The aim is to allow dragging of the items for a shopping list, using simple CSS/Javascript. The app should only use Javascript on the client for ordering food. The basket may be mailed. 

The changed innerHTML is now saved in a Browser DB. The adress is not yet saved.

ToDo: The draggable goods might be produced then out of a list.
Importants ToDo: The app does not work with mobile browsers.

many thanks for your contribution
