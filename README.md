# ClientbasedGroceryOrder
The aim is to allow dragging of the items for a shopping list, using simple CSS/Javascript. The app should only use Javascript on the client for ordering food. The basket may be mailed. Unfortunately the changed product name is not taken over by the base form. TODO: The changed innerHTML should also be saved in a Browser DB. 
many thanks
