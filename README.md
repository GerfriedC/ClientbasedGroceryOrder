# ClientbasedGroceryOrder
The aim is to allow dragging of the items for a shopping list, using simple CSS/Javascript. The app should only use Javascript on the client for ordering food. The basket may be mailed. 

TODO: The changed innerHTML should also be saved in a Browser DB. 
The draggable goods might be produced then aout of a list.

many thanks for your contribution
